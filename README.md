## Introduction
Hello, my name is Joseph Britt, and I am a computer science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology. My thread specializations are Intelligence & Media, and I have interests in game development, computer graphics, and robotics. I am also an admitted BS/MS student and will be taking two graduate courses during the Fall 2025 semester. I am currently seeking internship/co-op opportunities in the fields of software development, artificial intelligence, game development, computer graphics, and robotics.

## Recent Programming Projects
I recently completed my Junior Design Capstone through Georgia Tech's CREATE-X startup program. My team and I researched problems to solve through customer discovery and developed a tractor diagnositcs tool over the Spring 2025 semester to troubleshoot error codes and recommend replacement parts. I have also had the opportunity to work on a variety of semester-long projects through Georgia Tech's video game development club, VGDev, and I look forward to working on more as well as leading my own game in the future! Last summer, I completed several game dev courses and competed in 4 game jams while working part-time. This summer, I have had the opportunity to intern at Rezify AI, working on frontend development in ReactJS.

## Recent Learning
#### CS 3451 — Computer Graphics
#### CS 4731 — CREATE-X Capstone
#### CS 3510 — Design & Analysis of Algorithms
I learned about a variety of topics spanning divide & conquer algorithms, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and complexity theory while completing weekly proof-writing homework assignments. I really enjoyed the process and challenge of algorithm design and found the topics in this course fascinating.
#### Technical Art
I have taken in interest in technical art in addition to pure programming and development, and have been enjoying learning about the field and improving my skill set through my work on VGDev projects.

## Interests
### Video Games
I have always loved video games. There is something amazing about the freedom of expression, ability to connect with others, and unique methods of storytelling they allow. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I really appreciated the ability to not only maintain my relationships with friends, but to grow them and strengthen our bond through our shared experiences. I have long had a curiosity about creating games, from fantasizing about making Minecrarft mods as a kid to dreaming of making my own original games. Here at Georgia Tech, I have finally begun to realize this passion through my involvement with VGDev, the school's video game development club. Some of my favorite video games include _Minecraft_, _Hollow Knight_, and _Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order_.
### Robotics
I competed in VEX Robotics on team 5430A for all 4 years of high school, securing two State Championships, 3 State Excellence Awards, and both a Division Championship and Excellence Award at the 2021 VEX Robotics World Championship. Here at Georgia Tech, I am currently taking CS 3630 — Introduction to Perception & Robotics.
### Dancing
I am a competitive ballroom dancer through the Ballroom Dance Club at Georgia Tech. My partner and I compete at the Bronze/Silver level, and we coach the club's Newcomer competitive choreo lessons each Sunday. I am also a board member for the Georgia Tech Dance Association, the swing dancing club of Georgia Tech. My favorite swing dance is West Coast Swing, which I have been dancing for almost two years!
