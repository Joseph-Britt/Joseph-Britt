## Introduction
Hello, my name is Joseph Britt, and I am a computer science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

## Current Projects
I'm currently working on a game called [Altarune](https://github.com/Carlijavier5/Altarune) as part of VGDev.

## Interests

# Video Games
I have always loved video games. There is something amazing about the freedom of expression, ability to connect with others, and unique methods of storytelling they allow. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I really appreciated the ability to not only maintain my relationships with friends, but to grow them and strengthen our bond through our shared experiences. I have long had a curiosity about creating games, from fantasizing about making Minecrarft mods as a kid to dreaming of making my own original games. Here at Georgia Tech, I have finally begun to realize this passion through my involvement with VGDev, the school's video game development club. I have had the opportunity to work on the following semester-long projects so far, and I sincerely look forward to working on more as well as leading my own game in the future!

I also completed several game dev courses and participated in 3 game jams over the summer of 2024. For anyone beginning their game dev journey, I highly recommend [Unity Code Monkey](https://unitycodemonkey.com/)'s free [Beginner/Intermediate Kitchen Chaos course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg&t=23852s).

# Robotics
I competed in VEX Robotics on team 5430A for all 4 years of high school, securing two State Championships, 3 State Excellence Awards, and both a Division Championship and Excellence Award at the 2021 VEX Robotics World Championship. Here at Georgia Tech, I am currently taking CS 3630, Introduction to Perception and Robotics, learning about robotics topics including sensor models, decision theory, image processing, multimodal sensing, differential drive kinematics, state estimation (Particle and Kalman Filters), Markov decision processes, SLAM, probabilistic planning, trajectory optimization, visual odometry, and PID control.

# Dancing
I am a competitive ballroom dancer through the Ballroom Dance Club at Georgia Tech. My partner and I compete at the Bronze/Silver level, and we coach the club's Newcomer competitive choreo lessons each Sunday. I am also a board member for the Georgia Tech Dance Association, the swing dancing club of Georgia Tech. My favorite swing dance is West Coast Swing, which I have been dancing for almost two years!
