| Procedural Street Generation | A freeform street generator developed for my graduate Procedural Content Generation course. | Generated freeform streets based on a random number seed. Interpolated between street segments in my underlying data structure using Bezier curves to create the 3D street mesh. Procedurally generated rivers and bridges to cross them. Randomly placed buildings alongside streets. Adjusted various paramters to generate different types of street layouts (suburban, grid city, skewed city). |  | [More Images](https://github.com/Joseph-Britt/Joseph-Britt/tree/main/Street%20Generation) |

## Interests
### Video Games
I have always loved video games. There is something amazing about the freedom of expression, ability to connect with others, and unique methods of storytelling they allow. During the COVID-19 pandemic, video games provided a means of not just staying in contact with my friends, but interacting together in virtual worlds and making cherished memories together. I have found myself drawn to creating games for a long while now, from planning out ideas for Minecrarft mods I wanted to create as a kid to working on my own original projects through game jams. Here at Georgia Tech, I have relished the opportunity to collaborate with other students on game development projects through VGDev, my school's video game development club. Some of my all-time favorite video games include _Minecraft_, _Hollow Knight_, and _Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order_.
### Robotics
I competed in VEX Robotics on team 5430A for all 4 years of high school, securing two State Championships, 3 State Excellence Awards, and both a Division Championship and Excellence Award at the 2021 VEX Robotics World Championship. I have enjoyed exploring my passion for robotics further at Georgia Tech with coursework including CS 3630 — Perception & Robotics and CS 3600 — Introduction to Aritifical Intelligence, in which I utilized a variety of techniques such as Markov decision processes, neural network, Monte Carlo localization using a particle filter, PID control, odometry, and sensor fusion to complete a number of tasks and games.
### Dancing
I am a competitive ballroom dancer through the Ballroom Dance Club at Georgia Tech. My partner and I compete at the Silver/Gold level, and we coach the club's Newcomer competitive choreo lessons each Sunday. I am also a board member for the Swing Dance Social Community at Georgia Tech. My favorite swing dance is West Coast Swing, which I have been dancing for nearly three years!
