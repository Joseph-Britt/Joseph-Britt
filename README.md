## Introduction
Hello, my name is Joseph Britt, and I am a computer science student at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

## What I'm Currently Working On
I'm currently working on a game called [Altarune](https://github.com/Carlijavier5/Altarune) as part of my school's game development club. I am also looking into a personal project turning a card game made by my friend into a multiplayer Unity game, but alas, that will have to wait until winter break when classes settle down ðŸ˜….

## What I'm Currently Learning
### Relevant Courses
#### CS 2110 â€” Computer Organization & Programming
I have been learning about how computers work, building from transistors to logic gates to LC-3 assembly language and beyond. We are currently transitioning to C programming!
#### CS 3630 â€” Introduction to Perception & Robotics
I have learned about a multitude of robotics topics including sensor models, decision theory, image processing, multimodal sensing, differential drive kinematics, state estimation (Particle and Kalman Filters), Markov decision processes, and SLAM. Of our remaining topics, I am particularly looking forward to covering visual odometry and PID control.
#### CS 2050 â€” Introduction to Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science
This course has taught me a lot ranging from propositional logic and proof techniques (including some particularly interesting ones such as induction, strong induction, proof by cases, and double set containment) to set theory, number theory, and Big O. I am excited for our upcoming analysis of algorithms and cryptography.
### Video Game Development
#### Technical Art
I have taken in interest in technical art in addition to pure programming and development, and have been enjoying learning about the field and improving my skill set throw my work on VGDev projects.

## Interests
### Video Games
I have always loved video games. There is something amazing about the freedom of expression, ability to connect with others, and unique methods of storytelling they allow. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I really appreciated the ability to not only maintain my relationships with friends, but to grow them and strengthen our bond through our shared experiences. I have long had a curiosity about creating games, from fantasizing about making Minecrarft mods as a kid to dreaming of making my own original games. Here at Georgia Tech, I have finally begun to realize this passion through my involvement with VGDev, the school's video game development club. I have had the opportunity to work on the following semester-long projects so far, and I sincerely look forward to working on more as well as leading my own game in the future!

I also completed several game dev courses and participated in 3 game jams over the summer of 2024. For anyone beginning their game dev journey, I highly recommend [Unity Code Monkey](https://unitycodemonkey.com/)'s free [Beginner/Intermediate Kitchen Chaos course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmGSEH7QcDg&t=23852s).

### Robotics
I competed in VEX Robotics on team 5430A for all 4 years of high school, securing two State Championships, 3 State Excellence Awards, and both a Division Championship and Excellence Award at the 2021 VEX Robotics World Championship. Here at Georgia Tech, I am currently taking CS 3630 â€” Introduction to Perception & Robotics.

### Dancing
I am a competitive ballroom dancer through the Ballroom Dance Club at Georgia Tech. My partner and I compete at the Bronze/Silver level, and we coach the club's Newcomer competitive choreo lessons each Sunday. I am also a board member for the Georgia Tech Dance Association, the swing dancing club of Georgia Tech. My favorite swing dance is West Coast Swing, which I have been dancing for almost two years!
